# Local Development

The `up.sh` command uses the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file for itâ€™s build process.  This will both build and bring up the containers.  You can access the application at http://localhost:3000.  When I first accessed the application, I had to shell into the `web` container and run `bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate`.  To shell into the `web` container use the following: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec web bash`.
