		<h2>About the American Congress Digital Archives Portal</h2>
		<hr />

		<p>The American Congress Digital Archives Portal is a collaborative, non-partisan project that makes congressional archives available online. We provide open access to documents, photographs, and audiovisual items, as well as the descriptive information (metadata) about those materials. Below you will find answers to commonly asked questions.</p>
		
		<p><b>What are congressional archives?</b></p>
		<p>Congressional archives are the primary materials generated by Congress and that document the work of Congress. They are separated into official records and personal papers. The official records are those created and maintained by committees, and they are transferred to the Center for Legislative Archives. Personal papers include materials created or received by an individual Member of Congress as documentation of their career, the organization and functions of the office, and the work of office staff. This site features materials from the personal papers of Members of Congress. Sometimes Members may have documentation of committee work in their papers, so there may be some committee work represented on this site.</p>

		<p><b>Why create an online portal?</b></p>
		<p>The personal papers of Members of Congress support scholarship about American democracy and the work of the legislative branch. They show how Congress provides oversight, creates legislation, and represents the American people. Unlike presidential papers, which are centralized in one location with dedicated staff and funding, congressional collections are geographically dispersed among institutions large and small with varying degrees of resources.  For researchers, collections may be difficult to use, both because of a lack of travel funding and the breadth and varying levels of description in congressional archives. The pandemic has made these problems more acute due to archives closures and travel restrictions. This portal will provide easier access to scholars, educators and the public by bringing together sources from multiple institutions into a single online platform, illuminating the value of each collection and the relationships among them.</p>
		
		<p><b>Who created this site?</b></p>
		<p>West Virginia University Libraries is partnering with the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics at The University of Kansas and the Robert C. Byrd Center for Congressional History and Education for the initial phase of the project. Funding was provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities. The project also includes an advisory board composed of leading individuals in the areas of congressional archives and scholarship.</p>

		<p><b>What is included in the portal? </b></p>
		<p>In the initial phase, materials from # collections held by partner institutions will be included. Materials were chosen to test a breadth of document types and formats in the platform and to help prioritize those materials most useful to users. The materials in this phase were created in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.</p>
		
		<p><b>What happens next with the project?</b></p>
		<p>We aim to expand the number of project partners and sources leading up to the nation’s semiquincentennial in 2026 and to be the authoritative resource for locating personal congressional archives materials on the internet. We believe the project will lead to new topics of exploration and new methods of scholarly research, as well as becoming an indispensable resource for civic education and knowledge of America’s constitutional democracy.</p>
